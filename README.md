# MPLS Orchestrator
This project is based on Java technology.

Initially, I built a standalone Java application with a Swing-based user interface. The primary objective of the application is to connect to one or multiple router devices to perform automated configuration tasks.

The system leverages various libraries, including Telnet and SNMP for device communication, and uses an object-oriented database (db4o) to store configuration history and related objects.
